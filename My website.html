        In Japan, higher education starts upon the completion of 12 years of education: elementary education (6 years of elementary school) and secondary education (3 years of lower secondary school and 3 years of upper secondary school).There are 5 types of higher education institutions that international students can be admitted to, which are 1) colleges of technology, 2) specialized training colleges(post-secondary courses), 3) junior colleges, 4) universities (undergraduate) and 5) graduate schools. Depending on the founding bodies, these higher education institutions are categorized into three types: national, local public and private.

        <p>Key Aspects of Japan’s Learning Culture-</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Strong Emphasis on Discipline and Hard Work</dd>
            <p>Japanese students are taught to value discipline and diligence. This mindset is evident both inside and outside the classroom, contributing significantly to their academic and personal development.</p>
            <li>Extracurricular Learning (Shadow Education)</dd>
            <p>Supplementary learning outside school, such as attending "juku" (cram schools), is a major part of Japan’s education culture. These schools help students prepare for high-stakes exams, particularly university entrance exams.</p>
            <li>Family and Community Involvement</dd>
            <p>Japanese families are heavily involved in their children's education. Parents often encourage their children to attend after-school programs and are active participants in educational decisions.</p>
            <li>Cultural Values</dd>
            <p>Japanese culture places high importance on harmony and group cohesion, known as “Wa.” This cultural value influences classroom behavior, teaching methods, and student relationships.</p>
